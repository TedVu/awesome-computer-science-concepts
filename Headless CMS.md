# Headless CMS

Headless means "no head" and head in this context is the presentational layer, in short, a headless CMS is any type of back-end content management system where the content repository is separated from the presentational layer, the head. This means that a headless CMS allows you to manage content in one place and still be able to deploy that content across any frontend you choose.
